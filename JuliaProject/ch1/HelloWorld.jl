# Finished version of HelloWorld for Learning Julia course

# Define a function that prints out a message
# This creates a function with a single "method"
function helloworld()
    println("Hello World!")
end

# By defining another version of the function with different
# arguments, we create another "method" - Julia will choose
# the right one based on the arguments. This is called 
# "multiple dispatch"
function helloworld(count::Int)
    for i in 1:count
        println("Hello World ", i)
    end
end

# call the version with no arguments
helloworld()
# call the version that takes a number
helloworld(3)
# try calling the function with a string - this will error
# because we have not defined a method that takes a string
#helloworld("today")
